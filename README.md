# Hello 
This are all of the **problem sets** (except pset0-scratch) that I did to finish CS50 2021.  

# Note on academic honesty
These pset answers (made in 2021) will be outdated in the coming years for sure. However if these answers are still relevant and you're taking CS50, it would be best for you **not** to copy paste my answers. This is a course by Harvard University, and you could be exempted from the course if you blindly copy paste my code.

# Acknowledgements
I wanna thank professor David J. Malan, Brian Yu, Doug Lloyd and the rest of the CS50 team for creating this course and supplementing it with their excellent teaching, QnA support (through communities) and resources.
